This is a really simple project to demonstrate the basic
Activity lifecycle events. Each time one is called against
the Main activity, a log message is written and displayed
in a toast.

It's interesting to watch what happens when you transition
between the activities. Notice the difference between a
transition to a normal activity vs. the translucent one:
with the translucent one, onStop isn't called on Main.
Also notice what happens when you make an orientation
change - full lifecycle, including the onRestoreInstanceState
event (only time I've seen it).
