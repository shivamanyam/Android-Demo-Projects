This is an example of how data is affected by storage in a Sqlite DB.
As such it's not really unique to Android, but it's the DB folks are
likely to be using on Android, and also serves as a demo of DB usage.

For a detailed discussion of how Sqlite stores values, see:
http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html

The most interesting thing is that the same column can store different
data types depending on what you're trying to store.
I created this project mainly to study how numbers are converted based
on how they are stored and retrieved in the various column types.

The program takes user input, tries to convert it into the Java type
specified, stores that type into one of each type of column in a DB,
and then retrieves it as the second Java type specified.

A few interesting results:

* 1.00 -> String -> numeric -> String -> 1
* 1.23456789 -> String -> numeric -> String -> 1.23457
* 123456789 -> Double -> numeric -> String -> 123456789
