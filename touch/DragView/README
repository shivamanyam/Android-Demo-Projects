This example is the result of my investigation into how to get views on an Android screen that a user can move 
by touching them and dragging them. It is based on the Android Launcher code. The Launcher is the code that 
manages the workspace you see on your Android phone. Besides being able to launch apps, it allows you to change 
the layout of icons on the screen. That's what is in this example.

For more information about this example and how it works, read the following blog article:
